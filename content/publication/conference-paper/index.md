abstract: WAlthough U.S. organizations heavily invest in diversity training programs, little is known about factors that affect its effectiveness. We examined the role of organizational cynicism, that is, the belief that the management of an organization lacks integrity and cannot be trusted to provide truthful information (Dean, Brandes, & Dharwadkar, 1998). Preliminary work conducted in our lab has indicated that diversity training is less effective among individuals who are more cynical of management. In the present research, we further developed our measure of cynicism, distinguishing between cynicism towards management and cynicism towards diversity training.

Preliminary work conducted in our lab has indicated that diversity training is less effective among individuals who are more cynical of management. In the present research, we further developed our measure of cynicism, distinguishing between cynicism towards management and cynicism towards diversity training.
