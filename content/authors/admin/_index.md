Philip Simmons is a California based industrial organizational psychologist. His research focuses on how employee attitudes and contextual factors (i.e., leadership support, executive diversity, rational) affects the effectiveness of diversity initiatives. As a practitioner, Philip has developed science-based employee measurement systems, selection processes, and organizational improvement strategies. Passionate about technology, he seeks new approaches to blend the science of organizational research with data science.
